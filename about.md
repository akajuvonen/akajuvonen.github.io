# Antti Juvonen

Hi, I'm Antti, a Data Scientist from Finland currently living in Tokyo, Japan. I'm working as a
Machine Learning Engineer @ [Cogent Labs].
I got a PhD in IT and co-founded [CAP Data Technologies]. I have 7+ years of experience in Machine Learning and
software engineering.

My interests include programming (mostly Python), Machine Learning, AI, Big Data and technology.
I'm also a big fan of presenting complicated concepts in a simple way and will
write about my observations in the blog.
