title:  "TensorFlow 1.5: What's New and Building from Source"
---

So, TensorFlow 1.5 [was released][tf15] a few days ago. I thought I'd give it
a go as soon as possible, since it has some interesting new features, and I
like new things in general. Of course there were some hiccups, but everything
is working now.

# What's new in 1.5 (for me)

The thing that interests me the most is [eager execution][eager], which means
operations are executed immediately and not lazily. As a programmer, I like
this because it resembles other Python scientific libraries. I haven't had
time to consider all the pros and cons, however.

In addition, TensorFlow now supports CUDA 9 and cuDNN 7. I found installing
CUDA 9 to be a bit easier on my machine, since I needed to run some extra
steps to get CUDA 8 working. In terms of performance, I haven't seen a
significant difference in my tests. Also, note to self: even though CUDA 9
is supported, it doesn't mean CUDA 9.1 works (9.1 is the latest version).
It seems some people got confused by this.
