title: "Understanding LLN and CLT with Coin Toss"
---

In this post, I'm going to briefly discuss two simple but important concepts
in probability theory: law of large numbers (LLN) and central limit theorem
(CLT). I'm also going to explain the significance of these theorems and
present visualizations using an example.
