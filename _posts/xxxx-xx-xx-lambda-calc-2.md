title:  "Lambda Calculus: Beyond Integers"
---

I wrote about lambda calculus and how to encode integers using only function with Church numerals in a [previous post](2020-07-14-lambda-calc.md). This time I would like to take look at how to encode other datatypes within the same restrictions, namely booleans, pairs and lists.
